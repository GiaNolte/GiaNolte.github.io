<p>"I spoke in blossoming flowers<br />
And gathered the dying tongues<br />
Because lord knows they were still beautiful<br />
Even in death<br />
It takes a pure heart to see that the tragically damaged<br />
Are withering stardust.<br />
We must sprinkle a bit of them upon our souls<br />
If we have any hope for saving true art."</p>
        
<p>"She was falling in love <br />
You could tell by the way she sipped her coffee <br />
The way she dotted her I’s and crossed her T’s <br />
How she gently disheveled her hair <br />
And how she buried her nose in a new novel <br />
She was falling in love <br />
And you were a mere bystander <br />
Watching her life through a black and white lens <br />
Because you let go."

<p>“This journey will leave you breathless at times.<br />
It will leave you speechless—<br />
in awe of how delicate our hearts are and the shear beauty of life.<br />
There will be times of heavy burden and sorrow,<br />
But keep your eyes on the hopeful horizon.<br />
Tomorrow is a new day and that is a remarkable beauty in itself.<br />
Keep trekking for tomorrow, my friends.” </p>
    
<p>"To stay humble, remember this:<br />
Every living thing begins as a child. <br />
So, when we take ourselves too seriously, <br />
When we stray a step too far from the path of goodness, <br />
Look for the children. <br />
For they will guide you back to yourself."
