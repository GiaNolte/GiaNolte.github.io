    <h2>"Surpassing the Finishing Line"</h2>
 <h3>A glimpse into a University of Miami, fraternity mans decision to bike across the nation.</h3> 
<p>By: Gianna Nolte </p>

<h3>“We use shared experiences to support people with disabilities and develop the men of Pi Kappa Phi into servant leaders.”
—The Ability Experience Mission Statement </h3>

<p>If you had more than 100 brothers, what would you do for them? Would you wake up with the sun to bike across the Rickenbacker Causeway? Would you rally to raise nearly $6,000 (and counting) for philanthropy? </p>
<p> How about biking 4,000 miles from the West Coast to the East Coast?</p>
	<p>This June, Jason Goldenberg, a junior at the University of Miami, will be the university’s first to tackle The Journey of Hope—a bike ride benefitting Pi Kappa Phi’s national philanthropy known as, The Ability Experience. </p> 
   <p> A New Jersey native and brother of the Alpha Chi Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi, Jason’s ride will help raise money and awareness for those with mental and physical disabilities. </p>
<p>“We are very hands on with The Ability Experience,” said Goldenberg, of his chapter. “We have multiple events, per semester, with people from local organizations, who have disabilities and come to the [campus, fraternity] house.” </p>
<p> Side note: The Ability Experience is exclusive to Pi Kappa Phi and raised more than $15 million, nationally. Pretty cool.  </p>
<p>So far, Jason has dedicated numerous mornings to gearing up with his training buddy, Mike Connelly.</p>
<p>“We have gone out at five in the morning, six in the morning, to where you don’t see light for an hour and a half of riding,” said Goldenberg. “I’ve ridden close to 800 miles now and every single one of them has been with him.”</p>
<p>Living in the 305 for the academic year, Jason has the advantage of riding year-round thanks to Miami’s endless summer. On the other hand, he’s also mentally preparing himself for the uphill terrain he knows he will face during the journey.  </p>
<p> “The problem [in Miami] is, it’s zero elevation and zero hills,” described Goldenberg. “The ride starts in San Francisco and we go into Colorado almost immediately. There are some days we’re climbing over 4,000 feet.” </p>
<p> 4,000 feet. Yep, that’s about 1,200 feet shy of a mile. Vertically. </p>
 <p> “I don’t know how my body is going to react to it. I’ve been doing repeats over the Rickenbacker Causeway, but I mean those kill me after like four. I’ll kill it on the flats. Not worried about the flats,” he laughed. “The hills, on the other hand. It’s going to be a rough couple of days in San Francisco.” </p>
<p>Challenge accepted.</p>
<p>That same perseverance is something that follows Goldenberg in all aspects of his life. As a pre-med major, Goldenberg is in the midst of preparing for his MCAT, and will be applying to medical schools over the summer. When he signed up for the ride, he had one major question: will he still be able to do that during the two-month ride?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Even with a majority of his time being spent on a bicycle, the participants will have Wi-Fi access at stops along the way. </p>
<p>The Journey of Hope consists of three different routes—north, south and trans American. Each begins at a different spot along the West Coast and consists of 27 riders. </p>
<p>There are also 10 crewmembers that drive caravans within five miles of the team. They’re there marking each of the turns, providing water to keep the riders hydrated and rescuing them from bad weather or busted tires. They’re basically the backbone of the trip. </p>
<p>Brothers across the country are still signing up, but even the pre-ride preparations aren’t all that easy. Exhibit A: your training is tracked. So, if you’re not practicing, you won’t be eligible to ride. Exhibit B: You have to hit your fundraising minimum of $5,500, per rider. So, if you aren’t reaching out to your support system for help, you also won’t be eligible to ride.</p>
<p> With a jam-packed schedule like Jason’s, I was wondering how he maintained the ambition to accomplish all of these things. </p>
<p>His response was simple.</p>
<p>“Everybody who is in Pi Kapp, everybody in this chapter has pushed me into things I would never think of doing before,” expressed Goldenberg. “We all work together to push each other to the next level of what we can accomplish. I guess having all of those supporters behind me, really made me want to take my education, my college experience, to the next level.” </p>
<p>Pi Kappa Phi brother, Sam Fein, exemplified that exact support.</p>
<p>“When Jason first told me he was doing the Journey of Hope I was the least bit surprised,” said Fein. “Most people would cringe at the thought of riding from coast to coast, but he's always been one to step up and do things none of us would, or even could. To step back and look at everything he has accomplished since he set this goal is astounding. We are all so proud to call him a friend, brother and role model." </p>
<p>	Each day of the ride, Goldenberg and his team team will reach a destination where they are able to interact with local communities. The riders will be able to participate in ice cream socials, wheel chair basketball and wheel chair ice hockey, among other events. </p>
<p>“There are so many things that go into it that aren’t just the bike ride,” said Goldenberg. “Going to new lengths, meeting these new people, really understanding what their life is like. At the end of the day, it’s all about giving back to the actual community and working with those people to help them as best as you can.”  </p>
<p>According to Jason’s mother, Kathy Goldenberg, who is back home in New Jersey, Jason’s willingness to help others has never been lacking.</p>
<p>“Jason wanting to give back to others. He was always that way since he was a young kid,” said Mrs. Goldenberg. “And, he has such a get-it-done attitude. He told me ‘Don’t worry, Mom.’ This was his own thing and he didn’t allow me to help him, financially. He’s determined.” </p>
<p>On his own, Jason has purchased a new bike for the ride, raised $5,990 and aims to reach a goal of $10,000.</p>
<p> “Of course you’re speaking to his mother,” Mrs. Goldenberg continued. “But, he amazes me with his fortitude. He will do what it takes. I’m so proud of him.”</p>
<p>In case you’re wondering if Jason plans to rack up his bike for good after the ride, think again. Next year, he wants to take on his own protégé and train him for the journey. </p>
<p>“I don’t want this ride to stop with me,” explained Goldenberg. “I don’t want to be the person who did Journey of Hope and then seven years down the line Pi Kapp hears ‘Oh, we had one guy do The Journey of Hope like seven years ago.’ I want to find the guy who I can train for an entire year so, that he can keep passing it down.” </p>
<p>After two, long months of cycling through mountainous terrain, rolling plains, coastal cities and wide open country side, Jason will be welcomed home with open arms, by family and friends. </p>
 <p>   Though he’ll be riding over the finish line, 11 a.m. on Saturday, August 13 at Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., there’s faith that Jason’s legacy will follow him for years to come. </p>
<p>“Once you have somebody who does it, you’re breaking the mold. I want to be that guy who can break the mold.” </p>
